Choosing the correct benchmarks for evaluating performance of a target task or task-specific hardware development is crucial. Measuring program similarity can help in selecting the right benchmark to optimize for the selected target. \\
We present Datalynx, a hardware-based framework built for measuring workload similarity, providing the tools necessary for recording data directly in hardware. We first discuss and compare previous approaches to measuring similarity of programs and benchmarks as well as define the set of features observed in this implementation. Datalynx was implemented as an add-on to the open-source RISC-V implementation RI5CY and tested within the Pulpissimo microcontroller on the Xilinx Zynq-7000 platform. This implementation allows us to gather telemetry in flight in realtime, eliminating the need for time-consuming simulations as well as overcoming limited availability of data access or performance impacts when performing these measurements on unmodified hardware. While being a proof of concept, the actual core modifications named \emph{Enlynx} show minor hardware impact. We were able to demonstrate a functioning implementation of this approach as well as gather performance profiles from several industry standard benchmarks and categorize them into three main behavioral groups.
