I would also like to thank my good friend Charlie Long for his assistance trying to make this work sound English as well as providing the name \emph{Datalynx} through a misread on my end.

Lieven Eeckhout, Ajay Joshi, and Aashish Phansalkar, whose names I kept running into while digging through mountains of papers trying to understand what features of a program actually influence similarity, who have built much of the groundwork this thesis stands on.

Finally I would like to thank F.D.C. Willard for his insights into related topics and for inspiring me to broaden my horizons.
