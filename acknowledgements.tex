My parents, whose patience I have been able to stretch generously as I worked on this very lengthy project. As well as my supervisor Stefan Tauner for removing roadblocks and sharing opinions about FPGA toolchains.

Lieven Eeckhout, Ajay Joshi, and Aashish Phansalkar, whose names I kept running into while digging through mountains of papers trying to understand what features of a program actually influence similarity. They have built much of the groundwork this thesis stands on.

I would also like to thank my good friend Charlie Long for providing the name \emph{Datalynx} through a misread on my end.\\
As well as him, Taylor Wilkins, and Ashley Joy for helping me English good.

Finally I would like to thank F.D.C. Willard for his insights into related topics and for inspiring me to broaden my horizons.
