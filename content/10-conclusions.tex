\chapter{Conclusions}
    \label{ch:conc}
    
We have presented Datalynx, a new way to gather data about embedded workloads using a feature aware approach to program similarity. We demonstrated the capabilities of this framework using industry standard benchmarks and have thus laid the groundwork for more optimized implementations. While our implementation is rather resource intensive, we have been able to provide a proof of concept that may be modified to make sense in a more practical applications. Datalynx was implemented as an addition to the open source RI5CY core. We were able to gather performance data from the benchmarks validated on this system and demonstrate the logging capabilities of the system.
