    The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.}
        \item \textit{``Funny,'' he intoned funereally, ``how just when you think life canâ€™t possibly get any worse it suddenly does.''}
        \item \textit{A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.}
    \end{itemize}
