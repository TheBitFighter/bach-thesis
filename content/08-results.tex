\chapter{Results}
    \label{ch:res}
    
We were able to successfully generate performance profiles for the benchmarking workloads described in Section \ref{sec:bench/sum}. The workloads vary highly in instruction distribution, however for most of them, arithmetic instructions are the dominant instruction type overall (see Figure \ref{fig:res/overall/inst}). Not all workloads tested support hardware loops. Of those which do, most of them display vastly different \ac{HWL} utilization, depending on the algorithm implemented. We will talk more about this in the following. Of special note is almost 75\% of workloads take more than 50\% of branches (see Figure \ref{fig:res/overall/branch_tk}). Given the \emph{branch not taken} approach taken in RI5CY, this incurs high branching penalties. However, it also indicates a loop-heavy algorithm. In fact, all five programs with a load coefficient less than 1 (meaning less instructions loaded from level 2 than executed) have a branch taken percentage well above 50\% (we intentionally excluded \texttt{tak} included in the \emph{custom} set here, as it only executes 2555 instructions is thus too small to draw conclusions from). 

The opposite conclusion is not possible however, as loop size also matters with regards to the harsh constraint of a 4 instruction preload buffer. \texttt{nettle aes} and \texttt{nettle sha256} have a branch taken rate of 53.68\% and 91.22\% as well as a fetch coefficient of 0.91 and 0.71 respectively. Meanwhile Dhrystone only managed a fetch coefficient of 1.39 with a branch taken rate of 64.89\%. 

This also ties in the above mentioned \ac{HWL} utilization. There is little correlation visible between mean \ac{HWL} distance, branch taken rate, and fetch coefficient.

There not being any or little correlation between those metrics is in fact a good thing. The less correlation there is between these data points, the less chance for bias exists when adding a similarity profiler on top of these data sets. In future works we will explore the possibilities for benchmark selection given a certain real life workload and a set of possible benchmark applications.

Lastly, we have identified three major types of programs given their temporal behavior. Not all benchmarks have been analyzed in regards to temporal behavior changes given the relatively short length of some of them. The graphs of those which have been analyzed can be found in Appendix \ref{ch:graphs}. Group 1 does not majorly change its behavior over the duration of the benchmark. All metrics are unchanged over the entire run. One example for group 1 is Dhrystone as seen in Figure \ref{fig:res/dhrystone/inst} and Figure \ref{fig:res/dhrystone/fetch_waste}. The \ac{HWL} graph for Dhrystone is missing, as Dhrystone does not utilize \acp{HWL}. Group 2 shows sectional behavior changes, where sections have relatively stable behavior with stark changes between sections. An example for group 2 would be \texttt{bitcount}, the temporal behavior graphs of which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:res/bitcount/inst}, Figure \ref{fig:res/bitcount/hwl}, and Figure \ref{fig:res/bitcount/fetch_waste}. Group 3 fluctuates strongly during the entire duration of the benchmark. Examples for group 3 are the synthetic Coremark, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:res/coremark/inst}, Figure \ref{fig:res/coremark/hwl}, and Figure \ref{fig:res/coremark/fetch_waste}, as well as \texttt{sglib-combined}, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:res/sglib/inst}, Figure \ref{fig:res/sglib/hwl}, and \ref{fig:res/sglib/fetch_waste}.

\section{Metric correlation}
We calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficient of the different metrics collected in order to gauge metric interdependence. A coefficient closer to 0 is desired, as it indicates little correlation. A metric is intended to represent a single subsystem in the core and each subsystem is mean to be represented by a single metric. More correlation means more bias towards one particular subsystem in the data. For this calculation, we excluded benchmarks \texttt{factorial}, \texttt{nqueens}, \texttt{tak}, and \texttt{uart\_test} due to their very short length. Table \ref{tab:res/corr/coeff} shows the correlation coefficient between metrics. We see moderate correlation with the mean being about 0.25. 

There are outliers however. The most definite example is the correlation between the mean distance between \ac{HWL} initialization and mean \ac{HWL} iteration count. Workloads which use \acp{HWL} more often seem to strongly prefer more iterations, while workloads with more distance between \acp{HWL} favor less iterations. RI5CY provides infrastructure for two nested \texttt{for}-loops, this phenomenon in the data could be generated by \texttt{for}-loop heavy programs utilizing \acp{HWL} deeper down in the program. Pearson's correlation coefficient on its own is also not sufficient to identify dependent and independent variables. Further study would be needed to identify the exact cause of this effect. 

We also see a very strong correlation between the fetch coefficient and the cycles wasted. This has to be expected as more fetches require more accesses to higher level memory systems which in turn cause more cycles being wasted. Lastly, we found strong correlation between the share of branching instructions and the fetch coefficient. While this isn't surprising given most workloads seem to favor \emph{branches taken} (as suppose to \emph{branches not taken} implemented by RI5CY), more branching instructions directly means more instructions fetched. What was surprising was the rather small correlation between the fetch coefficient and the share of taken branches.
