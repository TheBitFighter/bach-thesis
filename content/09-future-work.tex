\chapter{Future Work}
    \label{ch:future}
For future work we intend to compare the benchmarks presented here to a workload representative of what might be run on an actual processor in the field. While running one very specific application can never be representative of all possible workloads in the field, we want to demonstrate the capabilities of this system in a more practical environment. We also want to modify the data communication bridge from a broadcast based approach to a more meaningful push based buffered approach. Accuracy of the in flight data was not a priority for this thesis, so the simplest approach was taken. 

Additionally, further work might be interested in
