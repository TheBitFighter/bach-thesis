# Project structure
Most tex files can be compiled on their own. Subfiles use the Latex-subfiles package. use `make clean` to remove everything but PDF files and `make distclean` to clean up the directory and remove everything but the tex files themselves.

*bachelor_thesis.tex* is the main tex file.
